        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Rashi Raval. I am a film, theater, and digital production major at the University of California, Riverside. I am now going to just post my UC essay bc you really can't expect me to write 500 words on a thursday evening. Thanks ;) XOXO the prettiest girl alive. Squishmallows: Why a Plushie Can Save Your Inner and Outer Space
Squishmallows. With 73 million reported purchases and 4 billion views on the Squishmallows tag on TikTok, it‚Äôs not a stretch to say that these cute toys have taken over the plushie industry. You may have seen some in your neighbor‚Äôs dorm room. Or, you may have one yourself‚Ä¶ But what makes them so appealing? Well, to answer this question, we need to see how they are made and how they are advertised, along with one ‚Äúgolden‚Äù aspect that granted them such booming success. Squishmallows are filled with polyester fiber and covered with ultra-soft spandex, creating their on-brand ‚Äúmarshmallow‚Äù texture. With eye-catching colors and almost endless color schemes, you can find the perfect one to spruce up your decor. They are also manufactured in 12 different sizes: from a whopping 24 inches that could serve as a luxurious and unique pillow- to 3.5 inches that can be useful stim and fidget objects for neurodivergent customers. As for advertising, Squishmallow‚Äôs creator ‚ÄúKellytoy‚Äù has used the versatility of this product to create over 1,000 character designs so you can buy anythin;lg from a cow to a pumpkin spice latte, but they also decided to make certain designs rare. This gave them the opportunity to market them as ‚Äúcollectibles‚Äù and monopolize on limited edition designs.   All of these are definite factors for Squishmallow‚Äôs success but the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù aspect that helped these plushies‚Äô popularity skyrocket was undoubted: The Pandemic. When the pandemic began and everyone was cooped up in their homes during quarantine, we were all looking for comfort. Squishmallows definitely rose up to the occasion. In fact, many people reported emotional and mental health improvement from these loveable toys. One of the reasons is each toy‚Äôs unique backstory, which can evoke relatability and discovery within the purchaser. Mine‚Äôs a candlemaker. So if you are in need of a stress reliever or even just something to amplify your dorm room aesthetic, Squishmallows is the answer for you. Fade in (waves crashing) 

Imagine yourself, enjoying the sun and sea breeze on a cruise ship. And suddenly, someone pushes you! You fall into the water, doggy paddling, and try calling for help, but the water keeps splashing into your mouth. Frantically, you try again and again, but your flailing is causing you to lose strength. You are ultimately‚Ä¶ abandoned. 

Truth be told, this is a very rare situation to be in- and I‚Äôm talking like 1 in 1.4 million rare. But what I‚Äôm about to teach you can still help you successfully keep your head above water without wasting too much of your energy as well as keep you calm in deep water. Today, we‚Äôll learn how to eggbeater. 

Insert music- flashy test intro How to egg beater in 3 steps

Step One: Your Stance
The ‚Äúeggbeater‚Äù or ‚Äútread‚Äù is a skill that I had to learn for water polo (insert pictures). I remember having an epiphany during practice that water polo may be called water POLO because the stance to eggbeater looks like you‚Äôre sitting on a horse. So I‚Äôm including it as a visualization tool for you guys. Pretend like you are straddling a horse so your knees will be bent and your legs will be spread out- not completely from side to side but to a point where you‚Äôre making a wide ‚ÄúV‚Äù with your thighs. Basically a squat. This provides you with a stable foundation. Adding on to this, you always have to keep your hips under your shoulders to prevent you from losing balance. 

Step Two: Leg Motions 
This step is where people have a little trouble. While in your ‚Äúpolo‚Äù stance, you are going to rotate your legs from the knee down. Keep the ankles loose as keeping the feet taut will only create more resistance for your legs to fight against. You can move your thighs slightly, following the flow of the knees. Each leg rotates inwards with the left leg turning clockwise and your right leg turning counterclockwise. A great way to practice this before getting in the water is to lie on your back on your bed or on the ground and do the motions. Another way you can do this is by sitting on a surface where your legs dangle as I am doing here. 


Step Three: Arms Motions- Sculling 
Your arms are going to be slightly under the surface of the water, with your hands pushing in and out in the form of an infinity symbol or figure eight. Most of the movement should be coming from your hands which dictate the direction that the rest of the arm goes. Your hands should push in towards each other until they‚Äôre almost touching and then out until they are parallel with your shoulders. The elbows should be relaxed and the shoulders should have minimal movement. This movement helps support your upper body and puts less strain on your legs if they aren‚Äôt strong enough for you to hold yourself up without sculling hands.

Add a segment where you reiterate your main points while in the pool
let‚Äôs get into the water!
I want you to notice all that we covered
Starting off Im in my water polo stance with my knees rotating inwards and my thighs moving slightly 
Next I‚Äôm showing how my hands are just under the waters surface making figure eights 
And I‚Äôm also leaning a bit forward on my hands and keeping my shoulders above my hips in order to help keep myself stable 
With these steps I hope you will become confident enough to survive attempted murder on a cruise! Or at least keep your head up in the pool in a less tiring way
